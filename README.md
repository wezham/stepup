# Description

stepup is a client library designed to help you implement step-up authentication 
in internal applications within your code base. Step-Up authentication involves
challenging a user to provide another factor before they can take an action 
in an application.

For example, suppose you have an internal admin platform that allows your
customer success team to modify properties in a customer environment, you can
implement step-up to prompt them for MFA before they can make the modification.

This feature helps helps protect against session theft in your environment.
